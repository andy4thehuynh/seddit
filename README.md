Seddit - My Saved Reddit Section Manager

I was tired of scrolling endlessly to find something I saved, but want to look at on Reddit. So I made this to filter by subreddit or post.

In v2, I'll include a way to delete saved content since Reddit accounts maxes out at 1000 saved posts. Thus, making it important to delete here, and there if you really need it.
